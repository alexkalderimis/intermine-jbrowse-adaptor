intermine-jbrowse-adaptor
=========================

A REST Feature Store implementation for InterMine data warehouses

This serves as a translating webservice between the intermine webservices and
the API expected by JBrowse.

This app tastes best with JRuby-1.7.4 (at least so I have found...)

Getting started
-----------------

* Get the code (you are reading this, so I assume you have done that)
* Choose a ruby (optional, but jruby is recommended - `rvm install jruby`)
* Install the dependencies (`bundle install`)
* Run the application (`ruby app.rb`)

Configuration
--------------

Nothing yet - at the moment beta.flymine is hardwired in.
